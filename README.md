# dwdiffviewer
Windows viewer for output files from dwdiff utility.  Written in VB.Net 2010 Ultimate, which seems to be free online.  Unit test project included.

The output from dwdiff can be piped to a file.  This utility just colours it green and red in a Windows Form box.

dwdiff can be found here, but does not run on Windows, sadly.
